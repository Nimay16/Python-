'Because of problems with her eyesight, rey the African penguin had issues with swimming. Thatâ€™s unusual for a penguin, and presented a big challenge for our aviculture team to help Rey overcome her hesitancy. Slowly and steadily, we trained her to be comfortable feeding in the water like the rest of the penguin colony. The aviculturists also trained Rey to accept daily eye drops from them as part of her special health care. Rey already had good relationships with some staff, and was comfortable with them handling her. Senior Aviculturist Kim Fukuda says the team built on those bonds to get Rey used to receiving the eye drops. "She knows the routine," Kim says. "I usually give her the eye drops in one area of the exhibit after all the penguins get their vitamins. When that happens, she runs over there and waits for me." Rosa, our oldest sea otter, has very limited eyesight, among other health issues. The sea otter team had already trained Rosa so they could examine her eyes, and built on that trust to include administering the eye drops she needs.'
